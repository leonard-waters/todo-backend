| Story                                                             | Route | Context | Controller | Tests |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|------------|-------|
| As a user, I can create a todo list;                              |  [x]  |   [x]   |     [x]    |  [x]  |
| As a user, I can add a todo item;                                 |  [x]  |   [x]   |     [x]    |  [x]  |
| As a user, I can view the items on the todo list;                 |  [x]  |   [x]   |     [x]    |  [x]  |
| As a user, I can check the item in the list, and mark it as done; |  [x]  |   [x]   |     [x]    |  [x]  |
| As a user, I can remove an item from the list.                    |  [x]  |   [x]   |     [x]    |  [x]  |
